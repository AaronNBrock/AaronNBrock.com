    comment: Love having Aaron on my delivery team. He's very much on top of things, often getting things done before we realize it. Moreover, he's been fantastic at collaborating with other coworkers on the delivery team as well as running meetings with client stakeholders. We've gotten great feedback on him personally from the client.

    comment: Aaron immediately jumped in suggesting Postgres for storing TF state which we ended up using at the customer! Now in my first engagement with him he has jumped right back in assisting with k8s installs of Jenkins and Artifactory. He has patiently helped me out with some things about Rancher I did not know and paired throughout.  He is super fun and easy to work with. He very quickly figured out every bump in the road with the helm installs.
